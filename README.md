## Epidemic-modeling-with-SIR
####Description
This repository contains a 2D agent-based SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) simulation with different containment measures. It models the spread of an epidemic in a small population, visualizes the dynamics, and calculates summary statistics.

####Features

Agent-based modeling in a 2D space.

Implements containment measures:

 1. Distancing/mask usage

 2. Systematic testing

 3. Travel restrictions

Visualizes agent movement and SIR states.

Saves simulation results in the same folder.

Usage

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the main/ folder.

2. Run the main script:

run_simulation

3.The simulation will produce figures and save numerical results in the same folder.
